# Automating-Clash-Detection-Resolution
This Dynamo workflow automates the process of detecting and visualizing clashes in Revit based on Navisworks XML reports. It extracts clash data, categorizes priorities, applies dynamic materials, and tracks resolution statusâ€”allowing for an efficient clash review process inside Revit.
